**ToneGenerated** is a blog devoted to audio programming.

On the blog, we're developing code using GNU/Linux, the GNU C Compiler (GCC),
and some other command line tools; however, most projects have few if any
outside dependencies, and should be readily ported to other operating systems,
compilers or programming languages.
